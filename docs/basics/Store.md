# Store

In the previous steps, we have defined the [actions](Action.md) that represent the facts about “what happened” and the [reducers](Reducers.md) that update the state according to those actions.

**Store** is an object that brings them together. The store has the following responsibilities:

* Holds application state;
* Allows access to state via [`getState()`](../api/Store.md#getState);
* Allows state to be updated via [`dispatch(action)`](../api/Store.md#dispatch);
* Registers listeners via [`subscribe(listener)`](../api/Store.md#subscribe).

It’s important to note that you’ll only have a single store in a Redux application. When you want to split your data handling logic, you’ll use [reducer composition](Reducers.md#splitting-reducers) instead of many stores.

It’s easy to create a store if you have a reducer. For example, if we had a single `todoApp` reducer in our app, we would have written this:

```js
import { createStore } from 'redux';
import todoApp from './reducers';

let store = createStore(todoApp);
```

For maintainability, we previously split them into separate reducers, so we’ll combine them with [`combineReducers()`](../api/combineReducers.md):

```js
import { combineReducers, createStore } from 'redux';
import * as reducers from './reducers';

let todoApp = combineReducers(reducers);
let store = createStore(todoApp);
```

You may optionally specify the initial state as the second argument to [`createStore()`](../api/createStore.md). This is useful for hydrating the state of the client to match the state of a Redux application running on the server.

```js
let store = createStore(todoApp, window.STATE_FROM_SERVER);
```

## Dispatching Actions

Now that we have created a store, let’s verify our program works! Even without any UI, we can already test the update logic.

```js
import { addTodo, completeTodo, setVisibilityFilter, VisibilityFilters } from './actions';

// Log the initial state
console.log(store.getState());

// Every time the state changes, log it
let unsubscribe = store.subscribe(() =>
  console.log(store.getState())
);

// Dispatch some actions
store.dispatch(addTodo('Learn about actions'));
store.dispatch(addTodo('Learn about reducers'));
store.dispatch(addTodo('Learn about store'));
store.dispatch(completeTodo(0));
store.dispatch(completeTodo(1));
store.dispatch(setVisibilityFilter(VisibilityFilters.SHOW_COMPLETED));
```

You can see how this causes the state held by the store to change:

## Source Code

#### `index.js`

```js
import { combineReducers, createStore } from 'redux';
import * as reducers from './reducers';

let todoApp = combineReducers(reducers);
let store = createStore(todoApp);
```

## Next Steps

Before creating a UI, we will take a detour to [how the data flows in a Redux application](DataFlow.md).
