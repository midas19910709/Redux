# `compose(...functions)`

Composes functions from right to left.

This is a functional programming utility, and is included in Redux as a convenience.  
You might want to use it to apply several [store enhancers](../Glossary.md#store-enhancer) in a row.

#### Arguments

1. (*arguments*): The functions to compose. Each function is expected to accept a single parameter. Its return value will be provided as an argument to the function standing to the left, and so on.

#### Returns

(*Function*): The final function obtained by composing the given functions from right to left.

#### Example

This example demonstrates how to use `compose` to enhance a [store](Store.md) with [`applyMiddleware`](applyMiddleware.md) and a few developer tools from the [redux-devtools](https://github.com/gaearon/redux-devtools) package.

```js
import { createStore, combineReducers, applyMiddleware, compose } from 'redux'
import thunk from 'redux-thunk'
import * as reducers from '../reducers/index'

let reducer = combineReducers(reducers)
let middleware = [ thunk ]

let finalCreateStore

// In production, we want to use just the middleware.
// In development, we want to use some store enhancers from redux-devtools.
// UglifyJS will eliminate the dead code depending on the build environment.

if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production') {
  finalCreateStore = applyMiddleware(...middleware)(createStore)
} else {
  finalCreateStore = compose(
    applyMiddleware(...middleware),
    require('redux-devtools').devTools(),
    require('redux-devtools').persistState(
      window.location.href.match(/[?&]debug_session=([^&]+)\b/)
    )
  )(createStore)

  // Same code without the `compose` helper:
  //
  // finalCreateStore = applyMiddleware(middleware)(
  //   require('redux-devtools').devTools()(
  //     require('redux-devtools').persistState(
  //       window.location.href.match(/[?&]debug_session=([^&]+)\b/)
  //     )(createStore)
  //   )
  // )
}

let store = finalCreateStore(reducer)
```

#### Tips

* All `compose` does is let you write deeply nested function transformations without the rightward drift of the code. Donâ€™t give it too much credit!
