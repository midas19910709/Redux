# Examples

Redux is distributed with a few examples in its [source code](https://github.com/gaearon/redux/tree/master/examples).

To run any of them, you need to clone the repo and run `npm install`:

```
git clone https://github.com/gaearon/redux.git
cd redux
npm install
```

This is **required** before you can run any of the examples.

>##### Note on Copying
>If you copy Redux examples outside their folders, remove these lines from their `webpack.config.js`:
>
>```js
>alias: {
>   'redux': path.join(__dirname, '..', '..', 'src')
>},
>```
>and
>```js
>{
>   test: /\.js$/,
>   loaders: ['babel'],
>   include: path.join(__dirname, '..', '..', 'src')
>},
```
>
> Otherwise theyâ€™ll try to resolve Redux to a relative `src` folder, and the build will fail.
